# XBolo

This is a set of instructions for XBolo. It was pretty much ripped from the original game's instructions. Some portions have been omitted as they do not apply to this version.

## The Game
The game of Bolo is a tank battle set on an island, for up to 16 players, using separate computers and monitors, so that each cannot see what the others are doing. This enables players to lay minefields which others cannot see, and to hide under the cover of forest and watch (or ambush) other players without being seen.

Another important factor of Bolo is that it is not a two player game, where your objective is to kill your single enemy, but a multi-player game, where you can work as teams. In this game you are not alone when you find yourself cornered by the enemy - you can shout for help, and have your allies break cover and come out of the forest shooting, to wipe out your attackers and rescue you.

## Driving the Tank
XBolo's default settings are pretty abysmal. I would suggest remapping your keys to match the layout of the original.

## Beginning the Game
When you start the game, your tank is out at sea, on boat. You should head towards the island and drive off the boat onto the land. You may have to be going quite quickly to leave the boat.

Boats can sail up rivers, but not under the low floating bridges which are laid by tanks. To pass a bridge you must either leave the boat and proceed on land or shoot the bridge to destroy it. Do not rely too much on boats as they are extremely vulnerable - they are sunk by a single hit. If you are on a boat when this happens you will be dumped into the water and will be at the mercy of your attacker. If you are out in 'Deep Sea' (water shown with dark ripples in it) then your tank will sink and be destroyed immediately - so take care!

## Terrain
On the island you will encounter different kinds of terrain and obstacles which have different properties.
