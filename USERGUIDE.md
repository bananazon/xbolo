# XBolo

This is a set of instructions for XBolo. It was pretty much ripped from the original game's instructions. Some portions have been omitted as they do not apply to this version.

## The Game
The game of Bolo is a tank battle set on an island, for up to 16 players, using separate computers and monitors, so that each cannot see what the others are doing. This enables players to lay minefields which others cannot see, and to hide under the cover of forest and watch (or ambush) other players without being seen.

Another important factor of Bolo is that it is not a two player game, where your objective is to kill your single enemy, but a multi-player game, where you can work as teams. In this game you are not alone when you find yourself cornered by the enemy - you can shout for help, and have your allies break cover and come out of the forest shooting, to wipe out your attackers and rescue you.

## Driving the Tank
XBolo's default settings are pretty abysmal. I would suggest remapping your keys to match the layout of the original.
